I believe that you are looking for good applications of Agile principles over the project.

E00551236 10/17/2022: I think your'e most interested in everyone contriubuting to this application in a positive way while taking what we learned in class
                      and applying it to the project. 

E00709167: 10/17/22
Observing our workflow in the SE lifecycle as we work and transition through each phase

E00707581: You are most interested in seeing us implement the key principles of software egineering in the semester project. That way you can see us succeed in using the material we learned this semester in a real-project example.

E00490237: 10/17/2022 I believe that the most important part you are looking for is not necessarily finishing the project but rather if we are taking the correct steps and following a development method.
             
E00579761: Employers are looking for hard workers who have the ability to learn and adapt to challenges.
                         
E00576418: I believe you are most interested in our understanding of each phase of the SE lifecycle and that we have put our best effort into the application of this.

I believe what the instructor wants from our semester project is less about the project itself, and more about displaying what we have learned from the class about effectively creating a project and following what we have learned through the semester through the process of making the project. Essentially, we as a team should display that we meet the learning outcomes.
                         
E00625195: 
Mr. Kinser wants to see that we have the ability to apply the things we have learned in class and to be able to meet the learning outcomes.
        
E00706696: Experience working in a group on a project. Since I normally work alone.

                         
E00574211:  Mr. Kinser is probably most interested in seeing us demonstrate our understanding of the learning objectives of the course,
            and our ability to function as part of a development team.
                         
E00686223: It isn't easy to say what someone else is most interested in. My best guess is you are most interested in seeing us apply the skills we have learned
in this class to the project.
                         
E00586376: I think you are most interested with the process of the project. You are less interested in the final product
and more interested in how we are getting that product.
                         
E00626335: Ball - 5 Requirments
                         
E00509471: Topic - Requirements
Why - Very important, and I think I have good grasp on how to deal with them
Prep - Read over past slides/readings and wrote down notes 
                         
E00501244: Design
I chose Design because it seemed interesting to learn how the steps of design are taken, getting into smaller parts of the requirements as more people work with each step.
I read the slides with the presenter's notes along with the website for design patterns, taking notes on what would be good to use in the speech.
                         
E00587378: Requirements
 -Understand and implement the software lifecycle when creating and testing our project
 have an basic experience of what it is to work on with a software development team and tobe able to document orally and professionally about software engineering
                         
E00639124: 9/28/2022
                         
E00607328: I am most interested in working with team members to complete a goal together through different tasks and jobs.
                         
E00570136: 10/17/22 - You are most interested in our thought processes during the semester project.
                         
E00572156: 2022-10-03: The most important thing is showing how we apply software engineering practices and our knowledge of the SDLC compared to actually finishing the implementation.
