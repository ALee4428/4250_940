I believe what the instructor wants from our semester project is less about the project itself, and more about displaying what we have learned from the class about effectively creating a project and following what we have learned through the semester through the process of making the project. Essentially, we as a team should display that we meet the learning outcomes.

I chose Design because it seemed interesting to learn how the steps of design are taken, getting into smaller parts of the requirements as more people work with each step.
